BDD Approach Using Cucumber and JUnit Runner
--------------------------------------------




This is a small example that how we can implement Behavioral driven frame work using Cucumber

This application has simple login functionality (Eg: southwest Airlines login )

Using JUnit, we can run the test with the help of annotations.

This program will get scenarios from feature file and execute the test sequence from Test_Steps.java using annotations

How to run this application

Change the credentials of the Southwest Airlines in Test_Steps.java

<Valid username>
<Valid password>

Run the TestRunner.java and see the results in the console.
